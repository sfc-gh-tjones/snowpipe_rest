# REST API for Snowpipe Streaming

This repo creates a REST API for ingesting data into Snowflake via
Snowpipe Streaming.

There is one endpoint:

* `snowpipe/insert/{database}/{schema}/{table}` - this will load the data into the
  specified table. This accepts the `PUT` verb.

The data is sent in the body of the `PUT` request. The data is a JSON array
of JSON objects. For example:

```json
[
  {
    "some_int": 1,
    "some_string": "one"
  },
  {
    "some_int": 2,
    "some_string": "two"
  }
]
```

If the database user running the service does not have permissions to
write to the specified table, a `404` error is returned. If the data is
incorrectly formatted, a `400` error is returned.

# Instructions

Before starting, you will need a Snowflake user with access to a warehouse
and permissions on the table(s) that you want to write to. You will also
need an SSH Key for your Snowflake user (see [here](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/key-pair-auth.html))

This example is driven from the Makefile. The Makefile has variables at the top
that can be overriden by either editing the Makefile or setting the variable(s) in
the Linux environment.

To build the application, run `make build`. At this point you can run the
application locally.

## Running Locally

To run the application locally, you will need to run with Java.
You need to specify a few parameters to run:

* `snowflake.url` - the HTTPS URL for your Snowflake account (e.g., `https://myacct.snowflakecomputing.com`)
* `snowflake.user` - the Snowflake user that the application should use
* `snowflake.role` - the role for the Snowflake user that the application should use
* `snowflake.private_key` - the SSH private key for the Snowflake user; this should be the private PEM file minus the
  header and footer and on one line (CR/LF removed).

There are some additional parameters that can be set to fine-tune
the Snowpipe Streaming SDK:

* `rest_api.buffer_manager_max_buffer_row_count` - the maximum row count that should be buffered in memory for a
  given table. Increasing this may cause memory related exceptions if set to high. Set at a conservative amount
  initially and increase based on throughput and how quickly you drain from a buffer via the `max_client_lag` parameter.
* `rest_api.buffer_manager_use_wal` - boolean (default false) if true will write data ahead to RocksDB. Will result in
  lower app memory footprint but depending on the disk may result in variable throughput.
* `rest_api.buffer_manager_max_shards_per_table` - the maximum number of shards per table. Think of these as Kafka
  topic partitions.
* `rest_api.max_client_lag` - the max Client lag that should be passed through to the Snowpipe Streaming Client SDK.
  Increasing this may result in more optimally sized BDEC files and thus better query performance for low-medium
  throughput rates but will result in more memory being used in the SDK. Conversely, decreasing this may result
  in less optimally sized BDECs but result in a lower memory footpring in the app.
* `rest_api.drain_manager_num_threads` - the number of threads that should be used to drain data from in-memory
  buffers. This essentially controls the number of ingest tasks. `15` is a sane starting value.
* `rest_api.drain_manager_max_duration_to_drain_ms` - the maximum a given thread should drain before returning the
  thread to the thread pool. If `rest_api.drain_manager_max_records_to_drain` is reached first however then the thread
  may exit before this duration is reached.
* `rest_api.drain_manager_max_records_to_drain` - the maximum number of records a given thread should drain before
  returning the thread to the thread pool. Same relationship to the above parameter - if we do not hit this amount
  before the maximum duration is reached then the drain task will exit early.
* `rest_api.drain_manager_max_seconds_to_wait_to_drain` - the maximum number of seconds to wait when checking the
  persisted offset token in Snowflake for a channel. This doesn't impact functionality but will cause a drain task
  thread to wait for longer before exiting. `120+` is a sane starting value.
* `rest_api.default_compression_algorithm`- The default compression algorithm to use when generating BDECs. Default
  is `ZSTD`.

You can set these by environment variable, as well:

* `SNOWFLAKE_URL` for `snowflake.url`
* `SNOWFLAKE_USER` for `snowflake.user`
* `SNOWFLAKE_ROLE` for `snowflake.role`
* `SNOWFLAKE_PRIVATE_KEY` for `snowflake.private_key`
* `REST_API_BUFFER_MANAGER_MAX_BUFFER_ROW_COUNT` for `rest_api.buffer_manager_max_buffer_row_count`
* `REST_API_BUFFER_MANAGER_MAX_SHARDS_PER_TABLE` for `rest_api.buffer_manager_max_shards_per_table`
* `REST_API_BUFFER_MANAGER_USE_WAL` for `rest_api.buffer_manager_use_wal`
* `REST_API_MAX_CLIENT_LAG` for `rest_api.max_client_lag`
* `REST_API_DRAIN_MANAGER_NUM_THREADS` for `rest_api.drain_manager_num_threads`
* `REST_API_DRAIN_MANAGER_MAX_DURATION_TO_DRAIN_MS` for `rest_api.drain_manager_max_duration_to_drain_ms`
* `REST_API_DRAIN_MANAGER_MAX_RECORDS_TO_DRAIN` for `rest_api.drain_manager_max_records_to_drain`
* `REST_API_DRAIN_MANAGER_MAX_SECONDS_TO_WAIT_TO_DRAIN` for `rest_api.drain_manager_max_seconds_to_wait_to_drain`
* `REST_API_DEFAULT_COMPRESSION_ALGORITHM` for `rest_api.default_compression_algorithm`
* `REST_API_USE_MULTIPLE_CLIENTS` for `rest_api.use_multiple_clients`

From the commandline run:

```bash
java -jar target/SnowpipeRest-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar \
  --snowflake.url="<SNOWFLAKE URL>" \
  --snowflake.user="<SNOWFLAKE USER>" \
  --snowflake.role="<SNOWFLAKE ROLE>" \
  --snowflake.private_key="<SNOWFLAKE PRIVATE KEY (as a single line)>"
  --<more params as defined above>
```

Alternatively, you can edit the `src/main/resources/application.properties` and add
your parameters there. Then you can just run `java -jar target/SnowpipeRest-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`.

Additionally, set the proper environment variables and run:

```bash
java -jar target/SnowpipeRest-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

Additionally, if a payload includes too many rows to insert, we will batch
the rows into smaller batches. There is a parameter to adjust the batchsize,
`snowpiperest.batch_size`, which defaults to `144`. You can also set it via an
environment variable named `SNOWPIPEREST_BATCH_SIZE`.

## Running with Docker

If you want to build a Docker container for this application, you can run
`make docker` which builds for the local platform.
If you want to make the Docker image specifically for the `linux/amd64` platform,
run `make docker_amd64`.

To run the Docker image (here named `snowpiperest`) locally, you can run:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 snowpiperest \
  --snowflake.url="<SNOWFLAKE URL>" \
  --snowflake.user="<SNOWFLAKE USER>" \
  --snowflake.role="<SNOWFLAKE ROLE>" \
  --snowflake.private_key="<SNOWFLAKE PRIVATE KEY (as a single line)>"
```

Note, see above for the parameters.

If you set the environment variables, you can also run

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 --env-file env.list snowpiperest
```

Alternatively, if you set the envrionment variables, you can
also run the Docker image using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose up
```

Or use the `run` target in the Makefile (which uses Docker Compose):

```bash
make run
```

## Test the API

### Setup

1. Create a simple table to test:

```
CREATE TABLE mydb.myschema.mytbl (a INT, b TEXT, c DOUBLE);
```

2. Grant permission to read/write to the table to the Snowpipe Streaming user

```
GRANT ALL ON mydb.myschema.mytbl TO myapprole;
```

### Tests

1. Insert one record:

```
curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '[{"a": 1, "b": "one"}]' "http://localhost:8080/snowpipe/insert/mydb/myschema/mytbl"
```

Expected response:

```
{
  "inserts_attempted": 1,
  "inserts_succeeded": 1,
  "insert_errors": 0,
  "error_rows":
    [
    ]
}
```

Check the contents of the table:

```
SELECT * FROM mydb.myschema.mytbl;
```

2. Insert one record:

```
curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '[{"a": 2, "b": "two"}, {"a": 3, "b": "three", "c": 3.0}]' "http://localhost:8080/snowpipe/insert/mydb/myschema/mytbl"
```

Expected response:

```
{
  "inserts_attempted": 2,
  "inserts_succeeded": 2,
  "insert_errors": 0,
  "error_rows":
    [
    ]
}
```

Check the contents of the table:

```
SELECT * FROM mydb.myschema.mytbl;
```

3. Try to insert to a table that you do not have access to:

```
curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '[{"a": 1, "b": "one"}]' "http://localhost:8080/snowpipe/insert/mydb/myschema/not_a_table"
```

Expected response:

```
404 NOT_FOUND "Table not found (or no permissions): MYDB.MYSCHEMA.NOT_A_TABLE"
```

4. Try to insert malformed data:

```
curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '[{"a": 1, "b": "one"]' "http://localhost:8080/snowpipe/insert/mydb/myschema/mytbl"
```

Expected response:

```
400 BAD_REQUEST "Unable to parse body as list of JSON strings."
```
